# Dashboard

08/03/23:
In starting another project I have a better idea about how I should plan the project. The main thing is how the structure works and second to that how the flex works. I think with this project the content collapses to a single column, then hides the side bar, then hides the "post-it" sections. All this while the header removes fluff and stacks the search bar and buttons.
