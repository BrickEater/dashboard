# Dashboard

Added style and spacing to the links in the sidebar. Pretty simple stuff to do and I'm happy that things are so straight forward now. I does feel like the basics aren't a problem anymore.

Finished with the structure and now I'm adding the links in the side bar. I just realized that it is more common to create the classes in CSS and then apply them instead of creating the elements with classes in the HTML and then style the class after. I was doing it that way before and it was making a mess.

Starting the layout of the website. I always struggle to make this without content at first but once I get this part down I think everything will be much easier. Right now I have a gap between each grid-area and I'm not sure why it's there. I'll have to fool around with the width/height of everything. I should try and remove the specific width/height of everything to see what happens.

In starting another project I have a better idea about how I should plan the project. The main thing is how the structure works and second to that how the flex works. I think with this project the content collapses to a single column, then hides the side bar, then hides the "post-it" sections. All this while the header removes fluff and stacks the search bar and buttons.
