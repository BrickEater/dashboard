# Dashboard

Starting the layout of the website. I always struggle to make this without content at first but once I get this part down I think everything will be much easier. Right now I have a gap between each grid-area and I'm not sure why it's there. I'll have to fool around with the width/height of everything. I should try and remove the specific width/height of everything to see what happens.

In starting another project I have a better idea about how I should plan the project. The main thing is how the structure works and second to that how the flex works. I think with this project the content collapses to a single column, then hides the side bar, then hides the "post-it" sections. All this while the header removes fluff and stacks the search bar and buttons.
